# INSTRUCTIONS

This document is meant to guide you in structuring your group experience through a written project proposal. You should work on this together in class, updating further as needed.

1. To start, **copy this document into a new GitHub repository**, to which all members of your group are invited as collaborators. (You can add collaborators on the Settings tab.)

2. Guiding questions are below. Working together, add your answers in the appropriate sections, and feel free to add further new sections as appropriate to your project.

3. Use git clone, push, and pull (and, if you're working separately at the same time, [pull requests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4)) to stay up to date with the official version of this document.


## The team
_Who is working on this project?_

Emma, Brittany, Fathima, and Weston



## The pitch
_What's the basic pitch for the project? e.g. What kind of thing are you making? Does it have a genre within that overall category? Who is the audience? What are your starting premises?_

We are creating an adventure-type "would you survive the apocalypse" interactive story on Twine.





## The strategy
### ... overall
_What overall mode of collaboration are you planning to use: divide the work by project sections? by media types and expertise? by compromise and consensus all the way through? (See_ Writer/Designer _pages 113-114.)_

We are planning on all working together as we go along, delegating small tasks where needed.

### ... in particular
_Now add some specificity to that general plan: who will take what role, at what points? How will you communicate with each other?_

We plan on doing a lot of the work as a group, but Britanny and Weston will specialize in the story writing, and Emma and Fathima will specialize in the coding/Twine creation. We have a group chat and google doc to communicate ideas with one another.

IMPORTANT: never include personal info like phone numbers on GitHub! But please do make sure you know how to reach each other, okay?

## The calendar
_You may not be able to pin down dates until you get into the mix and see what's easy and what's harder than expected. But because our time for this unit is limited – we have only until the Tuesday after Thanksgiving, and I'm guessing you'd prefer to finish before going on break – it's important to set goals you can update as you know more. So, for now, what are you trying to finish..._

**by Thursday, 2019-11-14**


**by Tuesday, 2019-11-19**


**by Thursday, 2019-11-21**


<!-- add additional dates only if needed; probably best to keep the scope manageable! -->



## The rest
Feel free to add any further thoughts, plans, or possibilities... or to answer additional questions from the Group Contract on page 116 of Writer/Designer.
